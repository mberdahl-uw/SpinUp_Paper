Data included here are:
- the ocean thermal forcing anomalies used for the CMIP6 runs (1990 and 2090 ocean profiles of T & S extracted from CMIP6 models, averaged over 5 Antarctic basins). 
- the ocean thermal forcing anomalies used for the synthetic Amundsen Runs, for 1C, 1.5C and 2C.
- Scalar output from the CISM ensemble for each forcing, p and gamma combination used.
