# SpinUp_Paper
Data included here are:
- the ocean thermal forcing anomalies used for the CMIP6 runs (1990 and 2090 ocean profiles of T & S extracted from CMIP6 models, averaged over 5 Antarctic basins). 
- the ocean thermal forcing anomalies used for the synthetic Amundsen Runs, for 1C, 1.5C and 2C.
- Scalar output from the CISM ensemble for each forcing, p and gamma combination used. 
- Jupyter Notebook that shows how the sampling distribution is generated for p, and gamma, and replicates Figure 3 in the paper. 
- Python script to read in .nc scalar data and one .txt MAF file (all included in GitHub).  Creates figures 8,9,10a&b and Appendix Figure 3.  (Please note that the paths in this script may need to be updated to match the path to the files.)
